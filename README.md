# Town of Babel

Welcome to the Town of Babel! This is a simple application where you and your friends (and enemies) build a beautiful (horribly ugly) town!


### Project Structure

The application is generally split into two parts, the server and the client.
</br>
The client is the application that the user interacts with. There are a few buttons at the top where the client can select tiles to use. Tap one to select it and tap it again to swap between similar tiles.
</br>
The server manages the clients and the persistent world. Clients send requests about placing tiles to the server, which propogates those to other clients.

### Installing

Simply download, install, and open the application. Its connected to an always online server, so that should be all thats needed.
